		no file paths), system info, and game state. No IP addresses. No user identifiers. No tracking cookies. Each report

		marketing emails. No third-party sharing. You can delete your account anytime and we actually delete the data.`,

		self-host it. But if you're a company trying to take our work and build a proprietary service, you have to open source 
		your modifications too. Free for modders, not for leeches. Free as in freedom. Not free as in you emptying the fucking keg.`,
